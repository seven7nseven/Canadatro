# an introduction to CANADATRO // aka WHAT IS THIS MOD??
canadatro is a random mod i decided to whip up across the span of 3 days for funny cause im not experienced with lua and i was bored the other day

THIS MOD IS NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY (i mean everything in it is in like lowercase so like  yeah)
also PLEASE do not read this mod's code k THANK YOU

# features:
- jokers that make ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE!
- menu music by graham kartna (BLANK 2 NOWHERE, specifically)
- a SINGLE boss blind that is the size of everest
- a singular seal :+1:
- oh also, a rarity called MESSED which are jokers that either do nothing or actively ruin your run

# so how do you install this :thinking:
step 1) you install [lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), you dipshit.
step 2) you download [steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), go to your appdata/roaming/balatro/mods folder (create one if you dont have one) and put it in
step 3) DOWNLOAD [TALISMAN](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman/releases/) CAUSE THE MOD IS ***DEPENDANT*** ON IT and put it in the mods folder too
step 4) download [the mod itself](https://github.com/seven7nseven/canadatro-balatro/releases)
presto your mods folder should look like this (or close to it cause i use various mod versions and stuff):
